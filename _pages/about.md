Hi, I'm David, a first year electrical engineering MS student at Columbia University. I'm looking for interns about SDE or Machine Learning. Now I'm studying database, algorithm and cloud computing in Columbia.

My current goal is to try new things and challenge myself. I'm willing to learning new things and stepping out of my comfort zone. Besides, I wish to keep fit and lead a healthy life.

I'm a crazy fun of soccer, and I like to play soccer in my free time. I enjoy winning games through teamwork, and I try my best to improve both my fitness and skills. Cycling is also my favourite sport, I love exploring a city with my bike. I'm also in favor of traveling to different places and trying different countries' food.
